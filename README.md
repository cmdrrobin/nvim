# I use Neovim BTWâ„¢ ðŸ˜Ž

This is my, [Robin Gruyters](https://github.com/cmdrrobin/nvim.git), Neovim
config. It is tailored to my needs and preferences. Feel free to read, inspired,
learn, steal, or whatever you want, but keep in mind it is my config.

## PLugins Extras

Some plugins are not always required in every environment, so created a function
to toggle each of the extras plugins.

I got inspired by [LazyVim](https://lazyvim.org) to not enable _all_ plugins,
but rather select them based on (work) environment.
